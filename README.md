# TikTok Hackathon

## Inspiration
Inspired by the frustration of sharing individual shopping links with friends, only to see those valuable discoveries getting lost in the shuffle, we identified a gap. Beyond that, we also envisioned a space where like-minded shoppers could connect and engage in meaningful conversations about everything from product reviews to the best deals in real time. 

Driven by this vision, we introduced the __Wishlist Collection__ and __Discussion Board__, designed to transform shopping into a more collaborative, organized, and delightful experience for all.

## Features
Addressing the social commerce problem statement, our project offers a solution to tailor these needs:

### Wishlist Collection
**Function:** An enhanced wishlist experience combined with close friends feature  
**Features:**  
- Create multiple wishlist collections featuring numerous products from TikTok’s shop  
- Share wishlists effortlessly, making them accessible to both TikTok users and non-users alike  
- The ‘Close Friends’ feature ensures a tailored viewing experience, allowing only close friends to see certain wishlists.


This feature aims to expand TikTok's user base while boosting engagement and sales.

### Discussion Board
**Function:** Facilitates interactive shopping discussions and knowledge-sharing  
**Features:**
- Threaded discussions with trending categories  
- Search functionality for easy navigation  
- Initiate or chime in diverse shopping-theme discussions, ranging from pre-purchase inquiries to timely sales alerts  
- Advanced keyword extractions and sentiment analysis for immediate conversation insights  

Through this feature, we aim to enable meaningful shopping discussions with other users which will boost social engagement
