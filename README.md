# Problem Statement 3 - E-COMMERCE (Social Commerce)

## Inspiration
Inspired by the frustration of sharing individual shopping links with friends, only to see those valuable discoveries getting lost in the shuffle, we identified a gap. Beyond that, we also envisioned a space where like-minded shoppers could connect and engage in meaningful conversations about everything from pre-purchase reviews to post-purchase advice and sales reminders.

Driven by this vision, we introduced the __Wishlist Collection__ and __Discussion Board__, designed to transform shopping into a more collaborative, organized, and delightful experience for all.

## Solution
